## CS readings (for me)

[Big endian and little endian](https://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/Chapter-15/ass15_3.html) - In computing, endianness is the ordering or sequencing of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory storage or during transmission. Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian or little-endian. Little and big endian are two ways of storing multibyte data-types ( int, float, etc).
